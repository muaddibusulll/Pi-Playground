## Tools 🪛

For my word list I used:

- Wiktionary
  For my English words. I used this because I needed to find the most common words for English.

Then I used Google Sheets, where I put all the words that I wanted and clean up some of the useless data. Then for the other two languages I just used a Sheet macro just to translate the words.

The macro I used is: `=GOOGLETRANSLATE(A2, "en", "el")` you can change the languages according to your preferences.
