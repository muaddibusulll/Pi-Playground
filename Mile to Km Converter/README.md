This is a simple converter just to make me familiar with the **tkinter** python library. And how to manipulate the widgets.

## Tools ü™õ

As I mentioned I used a build in Python library **tkinter** for my graphics. This library is specific for GUIs in python.

## How to run it ‚öôÔ∏è

It's very simple

- First you need to to have **Python 3** installed. (You probably have it).
- Then you need to _clone_ my repository.
  - Use `git clone <the name of the repo>`

* Now you should have the whole repository in your machine.

  - Now go to the **/Mile to Km Converter** directory and open your terminal.
    - From your terminal type, `python3 main.py`

## Final thoughts

**tkinter** is a very simple and nice library to use for simple GUI programs in Python.
