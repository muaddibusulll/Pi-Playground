# Other Projects ðŸ“–

In this directory you can find three projects that I created.

- [Blackjack Game](/Pi-Playground/Other%20Projects/Blackjack/)
- [Guessing Game](/Pi-Playground/Other%20Projects/GuessingGame/)
- [Higher-Lowe Game](/Pi-Playground/Other%20Projects/HigherLowerGame/)

## Build platform ðŸš§

All of these projects are builded in [Replit](https://replit.com/) platform.
So all of them have one import from the replit platform `from replit import clear` this import use to clear the screen when we call the **clear() method**

Long storry short **Replit** is an online code editor witch is very nice to write and run your code to your browser.
