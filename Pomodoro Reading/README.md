# Pomodoro Reading ⏰

This is UI Python program witch I created for my convenient. This program is very good for people who want to read and follow Pomodoro Reading technique for their reading sessions.

## Tools 🪛

I used the build in Python library **tkinter** for the graphics (UI).

## How to run it ⚙️

It's very simple

- First you need to to have **Python 3** installed. (You probably have it).
- Then you need to _clone_ my repository.
  - Use `git clone <the name of the repo>`

* Now you should have the whole repository in your machine.

  - Now go to the **/Pomodoro Reading** directory and open your terminal.
    - From your terminal type, `python3 main.py`
