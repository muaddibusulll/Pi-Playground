# Snake Game 🐍

This is a classic snake game.

## Tools 🪛

I used a build in Python library **Turtle** for my graphics.

## How to run it

It's very simple

- First you need to to have **Python 3** installed. (You probably have it).
- Then you need to _clone_ my repository.
  - Use `git clone <the name of the repo>`

* Now you should have the whole repository in your machine.
  - Now go to the /SnakeGame directory and open your terminal.
    - From your terminal type, `python3 main.py`
